# Engineering Portfolio - Rafal Modrzewski

Hi, I'm Rafal. My philosophy is to build resilient and cost-effective systems from the ground up.

This repository is a curated snapshot of that approach --> from the cloud infrastructure that runs the product, down to the frontend pixel the user interacts with.

### 1. Infrastructure ☁️ - [gcp_postgres_governor.py](src/1_infrastructure/gcp_postgres_governor.py)

>I was bootstrapping a product from 0 to 1, a surprise $5,000+ cloud bill was on my mind constantly, so I developed a cloud database cost-controller.

This script is my answer: an autonomous governor for a Cloud SQL instance that proactively prevents the issues leading to catastrophic cost spikes.

It's designed to target what *actually* drives infra costs for an early-stage startup. Things like connection pool exhaustion and long-running queries that force a premature, expensive upgrade.

My core principles are reflected here:

*   **Proactive Prevention:** The script identifies and resolves the root causes of cost overruns like hanging transactions, long-running queries, connection leaks *before* they can trigger a costly scaling event.
*   **Graduated Response:** To ensure stability, I used a tiered approach: first optimizing, then gracefully terminating, and only taking aggressive action in a critical cost-spiral scenario.
*   **Cost-Aware by Default:** The entire system is designed to run efficiently on the smallest possible infrastructure, directly impacting the company's burn rate and increasing runway.

### 2. Backend ⚙️ - [backend_workflow_example.py](src/2_backend/backend_workflow_example.py)

> For a startup, product stability is non-negotiable. A single instance of corrupted data can erode user trust and lead to costly support cycles.

This code demonstrates how I build resilient backend systems that protect the integrity of the core business logic.

The snippet orchestrates a campaign's lifecycle. The challenge wasn't just to write the logic, but to create architectural guardrails that allowed to add new features quickly without introducing bugs. My focus was on:

*   **Maintainability as a Force Multiplier:** A Python decorator (`@require_valid_campaign`) cleanly separates state validation from business logic. This reusable pattern drastically reduces complexity, making the codebase safer to modify and easier for new engineers to understand. Less time fixing bugs means more time shipping features.
*   **Scalable Orchestration:** A central controller (`_route_action`) ensures the campaign lifecycle is predictable and robust. This architecture prevents countless edge cases and provides a solid foundation that can scale with the product, avoiding a costly rewrite down the line.

### 3. Frontend 🎨 - [StrategicChatView.tsx](src/3_frontend/StrategicChatView.tsx)

> The user interface is where trust is won or lost, so I designed this component to feel fast, reliable, and trustworthy.

My key technical decisions to achieve this were:

*   **Optimistic UI for a Fluid Experience:** User messages appear instantly, making the app feel instantaneous while the network request happens in the background. This is a strategic choice that dramatically improves perceived performance.
*   **Robust State Handling to Build Trust:** The UI gracefully manages all loading, error, and success states. A predictable interface that never loses data or leaves the user guessing is critical for building long-term user retention.
*   **TypeScript for Long-Term Velocity:** I chose TypeScript from the start for stability. It prevented an entire class of bugs, freeing up development time to be reinvested into building the next set of features.
